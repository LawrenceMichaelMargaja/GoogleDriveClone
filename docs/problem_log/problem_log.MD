# Problem Log

### Dec 9, 2023
- **Solved** - We encountered a problem setting up our local environment, because

- **Unsolved** - There is a problem when logging in, maybe some residue of testing in the latest tutorial.
  - we are able to create a duplicate, which shouldn't be the case
  - Timestamp of interest: [1:48:00](https://youtu.be/Wn3IPX_ax-0?t=6511) - this is where we attempt to build sub folders...
